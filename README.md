# Websites
The MalNuFighter_Website folder contains my final projct for CSC 240: Web Programming from the Winter 2020 term at Union College. The website is intended to help solve a social issue in the local community. The social issue I focus on is malnutrition in low income communities and how this issue can be overcome through limited-space urban gardening specifically through growing potted plant produce, five gallon bucket composting, and providing produce nutrition information to provide low income communities the most "bang for their buck." This project uses HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. Originally the website was run on a Xampp server. The website was never published so due to lack of use, the messageboard, which was set up on nabble.com, has been deactivated. This repo also contains photos, videos, and Adobe Illustrator files necessary to load the full content of the website.
